## Bulter

Butler is an intelligent Task Manager. You tell it the task, its suitable space-time coordinates, the deadline and priority and forget having to sort through _hella_ long list of tasks, thinking what to prioritize over others.

Right now, the work is under process.
You know what they say ~ Good things are worth the wait. Well, we're trying our best to make that happen :)
